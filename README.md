# NFL Predictor

This is an attempt to use NFL data acquired on Kaggle to predict the outcomes of games during the NFL season.  I have yet to form a hypothesis defining how I plan to train my data set, but hope to come to one along the way.  

I plan to use a layered Logistic Regression algorithm with a number of features (historical player statistics) to define the probability of a team winning based on the players on the field.  

I am extremely new to ML and this will be a learning experience, so the code might not make complete sense to a seasoned machine learning expert.  I plan to educate myself along the way using a variety of Python packages.
